C - projects

Repository to present projects from course PB071 - Principles of Low level programming
During this course we had to complete 5 larger projects, each of them being tested and reviewed by our teachers

1st project - Hamming code (40, 32)
  - The goal of this project was to encode or decode data from standard input and print the result
  - For each 4 bytes of data you encode it to 5 bytes and vice versa
  - Focus: bit operations and basics of C
  - Rating: 86.70 / 100

2nd project - Texas Hold'em Poker
  - The goal of this project was to be able to decide who is the winner in Texas Hold'em Poker
  - This program can decide the winner in a game for 2 players where first you write abbreviations for player
    cards (2 card per player) and then you write 5 cards on the table.
  - Focus: Input parsing and logic
  - Rating: 70.67 / 100

3th project - Trash containers
  - The goal of this project was to be able to print/search/sort trash containers from a .csv file
  - Depending on the arguments, this program is able to sort, print out or group out trash containers in Brno
  - Focus: dynamic allocation, sorting and filtering
  - Rating: 75.48 / 100

4th project - Settle up
  - The goal of this of this project was to fix a program of "Settle up" - application for keeping track of
    expences between friends
  - This project was a bit different since we already got "working" program, but there were many bugs and
    mistakes
  - Focus: Orientation in a already build out project
  - Rating: 45.20 / 100

5th project - Disk usage
  - The goal of this project was to traverse given file structure and count the file sizes
  - In this project we learned hw to work with file structures by programming UNIX command 'du' and 'tree' so
    that we were able to print out file tree with the file sizes
  - Focus: POSIX and recursion
  - Rating: 83.57 / 100

Final mark from course PB071: B
